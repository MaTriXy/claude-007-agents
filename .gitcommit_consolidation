- Merge django-backend-expert â†’ django-expert (Context7 MCP, resilience, logging)
- Merge rails-backend-expert â†’ rails-expert (648-line comprehensive with enterprise patterns)
- Merge nodejs-backend-expert â†’ nodejs-expert (Winston logging, circuit breakers)
- Merge security-auditor â†’ security-specialist (1,032-line comprehensive security expert)
- Move business/ux-designer â†’ design/ux-designer (kept comprehensive 800+ line version)

PHASE 3: Documentation Updates
