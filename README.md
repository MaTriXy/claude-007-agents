A comprehensive AI agent system with **75+ specialized agents** designed for modern software development. Features **advanced AI orchestration**, integrated resilience engineering, structured logging, and live MCP integrations across all frameworks.

## üì¶ Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/avivl/claude-007-agents.git
cd claude-007-agents
```

### 2. Choose Your Installation Method

#### Option A: Global Installation (Recommended for Power Users)
Install the agent system globally and configure Claude Code to use it automatically:

```bash
# Install globally (choose a permanent location)
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/share/claude-agents
sudo cp -r /path/to/claude-007-agents/.claude/agents /usr/local/share/claude-agents/

# Or install to your home directory (no sudo required)
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/claude-agents
cp -r /path/to/claude-007-agents/.claude/agents ~/.local/share/claude-agents/

# Configure Claude Code globally (create/edit ~/.claude/config.json)
mkdir -p ~/.claude
cat > ~/.claude/config.json << 'EOF'
{
  "agents": {
    "globalPath": "/usr/local/share/claude-agents/agents",
    "fallbackToLocal": true
  }
}
EOF

# Or for home directory installation:
cat > ~/.claude/config.json << 'EOF'
{
  "agents": {
    "globalPath": "~/.local/share/claude-agents/agents",
    "fallbackToLocal": true
  }
}
EOF
```

**Alternative: Global Symlink (Best for Development)**
```bash
# Clone to a permanent location
git clone https://github.com/avivl/claude-007-agents.git ~/.local/share/claude-007-agents

# Configure Claude Code to use the repository directly
cat > ~/.claude/config.json << 'EOF'
{
  "agents": {
    "globalPath": "~/.local/share/claude-007-agents/.claude/agents",
    "fallbackToLocal": true
  }
}
EOF

# Update anytime with:
cd ~/.local/share/claude-007-agents && git pull
```

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Install once, use everywhere
- ‚úÖ No per-project setup required
- ‚úÖ Consistent agent experience across all projects
- ‚úÖ Easy updates (just update the global installation)
- ‚úÖ Clean project repositories (no agent files)

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå Requires Claude Code configuration
- ‚ùå Less flexibility for project-specific agent customization
- ‚ùå Dependency on global installation path

#### Option B: Copy Files (Recommended for Most Projects)
Copy the agent system to your project directory:

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd /path/to/your/project

# Create the agents directory
mkdir -p .claude

# Copy all agent files
cp -r /path/to/claude-007-agents/.claude/agents .claude/

# Verify installation
ls .claude/agents/
# Should show: orchestrator.md, orchestrators/, universal/, backend/, frontend/, etc.
```

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Full ownership of agent files in your project
- ‚úÖ Can customize agents for your specific needs
- ‚úÖ No external dependencies
- ‚úÖ Works with version control (agents evolve with your project)

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå Manual updates required when the system improves
- ‚ùå Larger project size

#### Option C: Symlink (Recommended for Development/Multiple Projects)
Create symbolic links to the agent system:

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd /path/to/your/project

# Create the .claude directory
mkdir -p .claude

# Create symlink to the agents directory
ln -s /path/to/claude-007-agents/.claude/agents .claude/agents

# Verify symlink
ls -la .claude/
# Should show: agents -> /path/to/claude-007-agents/.claude/agents
```

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Automatic updates when you pull the latest agent system
- ‚úÖ Smaller project footprint
- ‚úÖ Perfect for development and experimentation
- ‚úÖ Share improvements across multiple projects

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå Dependency on external repository
- ‚ùå Potential issues if the source repository moves
- ‚ùå Less suitable for production deployments

### 3. Verify Installation

Test that the agents are properly installed:

#### For Global Installation:
```bash
# Test from any directory
cd /any/project/directory

# Test with Claude Code (should automatically find global agents)
claude "List available agents"

# Test orchestrator functionality
claude "Use @team-configurator to analyze my project structure"

# Verify global configuration
cat ~/.claude/config.json
```

#### For Project-Specific Installation:
```bash
# Check agent directory structure in your project
ls .claude/agents/
# Expected output: orchestrator.md, orchestrators/, universal/, backend/, frontend/, business/, infrastructure/, etc.

# Test with Claude Code
claude "List available agents"

# Test with a simple orchestrator command
claude "Use @team-configurator to analyze my project structure"
```

### 4. Update Your Installation

#### Global Installation Updates:
```bash
# For copied global installation
cd /path/to/claude-007-agents
git pull
sudo cp -r .claude/agents/* /usr/local/share/claude-agents/agents/
# Or for home directory: cp -r .claude/agents/* ~/.local/share/claude-agents/agents/

# For global symlink installation
cd ~/.local/share/claude-007-agents
git pull
# Updates are automatic due to symlink
```

#### Project-Specific Updates:
```bash
# For copied files
cd /path/to/claude-007-agents
git pull
cp -r .claude/agents/* /path/to/your/project/.claude/agents/

# For project symlinks
cd /path/to/claude-007-agents
git pull
# Updates are automatic due to symlink
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Auto-Configuration (Recommended)
```bash
claude "Use team-configurator to set up my AI development team"
```
This will automatically:
- üîç **Detect your stack** (Rails, Django, React, TypeScript, etc.)
- ü§ñ **Configure specialists** with resilience and logging integration  
- üìù **Create/update CLAUDE.md** with your personalized team setup
- üéØ **Provide usage examples** tailored to your project

### Manual Setup
1. **Use agents directly**: `"Use rails-backend-expert to build authentication with circuit breakers"`
2. **Leverage orchestration**: `"Use @orchestrator to build a scalable e-commerce platform"`
3. **Extend the system** by creating new agents with provided templates

## üèóÔ∏è What Makes This Different

### Engineering Excellence First
Every agent prioritizes:
- üèóÔ∏è **Code Quality**: Evil Corp standards for maintainable, extensible code
- ‚ö° **Fault Tolerance**: Circuit breakers, retry mechanisms, graceful degradation
- üìä **Structured Logging**: JSON logging, contextual information, observability
- üîÑ **Self-Healing**: Automatic recovery patterns and health monitoring

### Live MCP Integrations
- **GitHub MCP**: Live repository operations, PR management, workflow automation
- **Task Master MCP**: Project task management, complexity analysis, dependency tracking
- **Context7 MCP**: Up-to-date library documentation and code examples
