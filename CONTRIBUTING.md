## ü§ñ Creating New Agents

### Agent File Structure

All agents must follow this exact YAML frontmatter format:

```markdown
---
name: agent-name
description: |
  Detailed description of the agent's capabilities and specializations.
  
  Specializes in:
  - Specific capability 1
  - Specific capability 2
  - Specific capability 3
  
  Use when:
  - Situation 1
  - Situation 2
  - Situation 3
tools: [Read, Write, Edit, MultiEdit, Bash, Grep, Glob, LS, mcp__basic-memory__write_note, mcp__basic-memory__read_note, mcp__basic-memory__search_notes, mcp__basic-memory__build_context, mcp__basic-memory__edit_note]
proactive: false
triggers: ["keyword1", "keyword2", "keyword3", "specific phrases"]
---

Your agent content in markdown format...
```

### Agent Categories

Place your agent in the appropriate category directory:

- **`.claude/agents/universal/`** - Cross-cutting agents (all languages/frameworks)
- **`.claude/agents/specialized/[technology]/`** - Technology-specific agents
- **`.claude/agents/orchestrators/`** - High-level coordination agents
- **`.claude/agents/core/`** - Essential development tools
- **`.claude/agents/creative/`** - Creative problem-solving agents
- **`.claude/agents/business/`** - Business and product strategy agents
- **`.claude/agents/infrastructure/`** - Infrastructure and operations agents
- **`.claude/agents/security/`** - Security and compliance agents
- **`.claude/agents/automation/`** - CI/CD and automation agents
- **`.claude/agents/data/`** - Data engineering and analytics agents
- **`.claude/agents/ai/`** - AI and machine learning agents
- **`.claude/agents/frontend/`** - Frontend development agents

### MCP Integration Requirements

All core development agents MUST include Basic Memory MCP integration:

```markdown
## Basic Memory MCP Integration
You have access to Basic Memory MCP for [domain] patterns and [specific knowledge]:
- Use `mcp__basic-memory__write_note` to store [specific patterns and insights]
- Use `mcp__basic-memory__read_note` to retrieve [previous implementations and patterns]
- Use `mcp__basic-memory__search_notes` to find [similar challenges and solutions]
- Use `mcp__basic-memory__build_context` to gather [contextual information]
- Use `mcp__basic-memory__edit_note` to maintain [living documentation]
- Store [organizational knowledge and learning patterns]
```

### Agent Registration

When creating a new agent, you must also update `.claude/agents/agents.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "your-agent-name",
  "file": ".claude/agents/category/your-agent-name.md",
  "description": "Brief agent description",
  "category": "appropriate-category",
  "proactive": false,
  "triggers": ["trigger1", "trigger2"],
  "dependencies": ["dependent-agent-1", "dependent-agent-2"]
}
```

## üìù Documentation Standards
