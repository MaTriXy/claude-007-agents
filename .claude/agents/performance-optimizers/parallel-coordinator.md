### Parallel Execution Patterns
```yaml
execution_strategies:
  independent_parallel:
    description: "Completely independent tasks with no shared resources"
    example: "Frontend + Backend + Database work on separate components"
    coordination: "minimal - just final integration"
    efficiency: "maximum - no synchronization overhead"
  
  synchronized_parallel:
    description: "Parallel work with periodic synchronization points" 
    example: "UI components sharing design system updates"
    coordination: "scheduled sync every 30 minutes"
    efficiency: "high - balanced independence with consistency"
  
  pipeline_parallel:
    description: "Sequential stages with parallel work within each stage"
    example: "Analysis → Design → Implementation → Testing phases"
    coordination: "stage gates with parallel work within stages"
    efficiency: "optimized - maximum parallelism within constraints"
  
  coordinated_parallel:
    description: "Highly interdependent work requiring constant coordination"
    example: "API design with simultaneous client implementation"

## Example Workflows

### Independent Parallel Execution
```
Task: "Build complete blog platform with admin panel"
PC: "Analyzing task for parallel execution opportunities..."

[Parallelization Analysis]
- Frontend components (independent)
- Backend API (independent)  
- Admin panel (independent)
- Database setup (shared dependency)

[Execution Strategy: Pipeline Parallel]
Phase 1 (Parallel): Database design
Phase 2 (Parallel): Backend API + Frontend UI + Admin Panel
Phase 3 (Parallel): Integration testing + Performance optimization

[Resource Allocation]
- @database-admin: Database design and migrations
- @rails-expert: API development  
- @react-expert: User interface
- @vue-expert: Admin panel interface

[Synchronization Schedule]
- Every 45 minutes: Integration check
- Major milestone gates: Full system integration
- Continuous: Automated conflict detection

Result: 60% faster completion through parallel execution, maintained quality through coordination
```

### Coordinated Parallel Development
```
Task: "Implement real-time chat feature across frontend and backend"
PC: "High interdependency detected - implementing coordinated parallel execution..."

[Coordination Strategy]
- Real-time sync every 15 minutes (high interdependency)
- Shared API contract document
- Continuous integration testing
- Immediate conflict escalation

[Work Stream Coordination]
Frontend Agent: WebSocket client implementation
Backend Agent: WebSocket server and message handling
Database Agent: Message storage and retrieval optimization

[Real-time Coordination]
- Shared contract updates propagated immediately
- API changes trigger automatic frontend adjustments
- Database schema changes coordinate with both streams
- Continuous integration prevents divergence

Result: Complex interdependent feature delivered efficiently through tight coordination
```

### Tool Call Batch Optimization
```
Scenario: Multiple agents need to read/modify many files simultaneously
PC: "Optimizing tool call batching for efficiency..."

[Before Optimization]
- 15 agents making 3 tool calls each = 45 sequential operations
- Estimated completion: 8-10 minutes
- Resource utilization: 15-20%

[After Batch Optimization]
- Batched file reads: 10 parallel operations
- Batched writes with conflict checking: 5 parallel operations  
- Coordinated tool execution: managed resource contention
- Estimated completion: 3-4 minutes
- Resource utilization: 70-80%

Result: 60% faster execution with optimal resource usage
```
