# MOVED: UX Designer Agent

The `ux-designer.md` file has been moved to maintain better categorization and eliminate duplication.

**Previous Location**: `.claude/agents/business/ux-designer.md` (basic implementation)

**New Canonical Location**: `.claude/agents/design/ux-designer.md` (comprehensive implementation)

**Reason**: The design category version contains a comprehensive 800+ line implementation with:
- Advanced design system architecture
- Accessibility implementation guidelines
- User research frameworks
- Component library structures
- WCAG compliance standards

The business category version was a basic 79-line stub that has been replaced.

**Date Moved**: 2025-08-02

**Part of**: Phase 2 Agent Consolidation - Framework Specialists

Use `@ux-designer` to access the comprehensive UX design agent in the design category.
