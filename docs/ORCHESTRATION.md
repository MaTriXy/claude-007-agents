## 🎯 Best Practices for Orchestration

### 1. **Trust the System**
```bash
# Instead of micromanaging agents:
❌ "Use @react-expert then @performance-optimizer then @security-auditor"

# Let orchestration coordinate:
✅ "Build secure, high-performance user dashboard"
# → Auto-triggers Feature Development Dance with optimal agent coordination
```

### 2. **Leverage Memory**
```bash
# Build on organizational knowledge:
✅ "Use patterns from our successful auth implementation for OAuth integration"
✅ "Apply performance optimizations that worked well in Project Alpha"
✅ "Reference security patterns from our compliance audit"
```

### 3. **Quality Integration**
```bash
# Include quality throughout workflow:
✅ "Build payment system with comprehensive testing and security review"
✅ "Implement user management with automated quality gates"
✅ "Create API with performance monitoring and documentation"
```

### 4. **Context Clarity**
```bash
# Provide clear context for optimal orchestration:
✅ "Build enterprise-grade file upload with 99.9% uptime requirement"
✅ "Create mobile-responsive dashboard for 10K+ concurrent users"  
✅ "Implement GDPR-compliant user data processing for EU customers"
```
