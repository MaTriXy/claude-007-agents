### Orchestration Intelligence Patterns

#### Pattern 1: Complexity-Adaptive Routing
- **Simple Tasks (1-3)**: Direct delegation to single specialist with quality checkpoint
- **Medium Tasks (4-6)**: 2-3 agent coordination with parallel streams and integration checkpoints  
- **Complex Tasks (7-10)**: Full three-phase orchestration with multiple parallel workstreams

#### Pattern 2: Domain-Intelligent Assembly
- **Full-Stack Development**: Primary (backend + frontend specialists), Support (database + API), Quality (code review + security), Integration (DevOps)
- **Enterprise Architecture**: Planning (cloud + system architects), Security (audit + DevSecOps), Implementation (framework specialists), Operations (SRE + observability)
- **AI/ML Products**: AI Leadership (ML engineer + data engineer), Technical Foundation (Python + cloud), Product & Quality (product manager + UX), Specialized Support (BI + analytics)

#### Pattern 3: Performance-Optimized Execution
- **Parallel Stream Orchestration**: Independent streams (backend + frontend + infrastructure), dependency streams (database → API → frontend)
- **Resource Management**: Agent load balancing, context sharing, quality gates, adaptive routing
- **Critical Path Optimization**: Focus resources on bottleneck tasks, speculative execution, result streaming
