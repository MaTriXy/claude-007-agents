# Coding Rules & Best Practices Guide

## Overview

The Unified Agent System includes a comprehensive coding rules and best practices system that ensures consistent code quality across all development agents. All rules are stored in Basic Memory MCP and automatically applied during code generation and reviews.

## üìã Quick Start

### Adding New Rules
```bash
# Language-specific rules
"Add rule python:S1500 - Use context managers for file operations"

3. **Provide Context**: Explain why specific rules apply to the situation
4. **Update Rules**: Contribute new examples and patterns back to the rule system

### For Users
1. **Use Direct Requests**: Ask for specific rules using the standard format
2. **Provide Context**: Include framework or use case when adding rules
3. **Be Specific**: Specify language and severity when creating new rules
4. **Update Regularly**: Keep rules current with evolving best practices

### For Code Reviews
1. **Reference Specific Rules**: Always cite rule IDs when providing feedback
2. **Explain Violations**: Provide clear examples of rule violations and fixes
